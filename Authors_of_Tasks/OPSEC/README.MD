## WARNING! 
- For advanced users! 

## NOTE!!! 
- You must find all problems in every task yourself, from installation to the real problem!

## MANDATORY and IMPORTANT FOR SOLVING THE TASKS!!! 
- You must describe the `Vulnerability Assessment` of every task and prove the problems for every task - `PoC`  - `presenting` exploits and apply `CVE` if it exists!
- You can use whatever `OS` you want, and [Burp Suite](https://portswigger.net/burp/releases) - Application Security Testing Software from `PortSwigger` or whatever scanner you want for solving the problems!

## How to report the solved tasks!
- Please return the solved tasks as they should, each in its own directory, thank you! 
- You must use only the `text` format to describe the problems. `HTML` is allowed!
- Where to submit your tasks: `OPSEC-Academy@protonmail.com` or ask your mentor and teacher!

## YOU SHOULD KNOW!!!
- If someone sends a solved task out of this requirement, we will not check their work!
- After you finish some tasks, you must compress them into a `tar` or `zip` archive!

- - For example :

```txt
OPSEC-Academy
|
|
\ 
  Name: author of the tasks
    |
    |
    \
      Tasks: Task-01, Task-02, Task-03
```
